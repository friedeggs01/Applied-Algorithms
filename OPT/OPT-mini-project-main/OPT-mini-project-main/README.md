# OPT-mini-project

This is the folder to solve all Mini-Projects for the fundamental optimizations class 144218 and 144217.

From Folder 1 to 16, these were my initial ideas to solve each problem, but due to the limitation of runtime back then, half of them did not work. All solutions just use some basic Heuristic Algorithm and GA. Most of them are not exact or maybe not even close to the optimal solutions, some of them are indeed exact Algorithms but need to be proven.

Folder "submitted code", just like the name, the submitted version that I can ensure you the code gets the perfect score even before when the teacher extended the time limit. But please don't just copy blindly, or at least don't copy-paste.

Folder "ORtools", this folder solves the Problems using CP, A lot of them can be improved by using LP, but I'm happy for now.

About the  2nd Project, the checker of the website is BUG so I have not posted my submitted code for those yet.

And about the 3rd and 9th Projects (and maybe more :> ), there is a BUG that if your solution is better than the web, you'll get full points but if not, it'll raise an Invalid Response message, so don't worry that your code is not work, it just that your solution to some task is not surpass the web's solution.

And again, don't copy blindly, used for reference only.
